# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = In the original Baldur's Gate, Imoen was a late addition to the game. Unfortunately, this means that she has no banter dialogs or interactions with other NPCs. Her voice set was also cobbled together. This mod expands Imoen's voice set and adds interaction banters with other NPCs.
